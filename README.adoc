rawm
=====

A fully manual tiling window manager for the X window system.

Concepts
--------

Most *manual* window managers aren't *truly* manual. They behave like a dynamic one sometimes. However, rawm is fully manual. It doesn't do this.

When a window is spawned without allocating space, it's put in an invisible queue. Then you allocate space for the window; when the window is pulled from the queue, it goes into the aforementioned space. This solves the classic problem with regular window managers, where the window with a longer start time will spawn in the current tag (workspace) instead of the one in which it was opened in.

In rawm, empty spaces available for windows behave like a normal window does. You can resize and move around them. Ergo, you don't need to re-learn how a tiling window manager behaves and works.

Configuration
-------------

Configuration languages are confusing. They are neither flexible nor easy to use. Moreover, it adds a lot of complexity to the program itself.
`rawm` listens to a socket and offers a basic client, `rawmc`, to communicate with rawm. Much like how `bspwm` works.

This allows the user to write the configuration in any language, while also removing the need to have a custom hotkey manager since you can use external tools like https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd] instead.

Dependencies
------------

* `libxcb`
* `pkgconfig` (make)

Building
--------

For the most part, configuration is done in link:config.mk[config.mk].

. Make sure to have the dependencies installed.
. `make`
. `sudo make install`

*NOTE*: If you want to use `rawm` with a Display Manager, you need to manually install link:misc/rawm.desktop[misc/rawm.desktop] to `/usr/share/xsessions` either by manually moving the file or by installing `rawm` to `/usr` (`sudo make PREFIX=/usr install`).
